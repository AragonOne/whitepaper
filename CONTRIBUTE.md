# Contributing to the Aragon Network Paper

The Aragon Network will be the first community governed decentralized organization whose goal is to act as a digital jurisdiction. This paper describes the mechanism and economics that constitute the network.

In our opinion, Git provides the perfect set of tools to visualize the work behind writing a paper. Through commits, pull requests and issues one can see who contributed, and in what way and what effect it had on the final version. We anticipate that the document will continue to evolve as we prototype, experiment, and implement the mechanisms described here.

We decided to use this technology to draft The Aragon Network Paper and we encourage others to join in to bring more transparency and collaboration to this process. If you would like to discuss the technical details of specific mechanisms referenced in the paper, but not necessarilly raise a specific issue or propose a change please create a thread in our [research forum](https://research.aragon.org).

This processes is structured similarly to and inspired by [DemocracyEarths's Social Smart Contract Repository](https://github.com/DemocracyEarth/paper)

## Referencing this document

The Aragon Network Paper is intended to evolve over time as our community researches, prototypes, and tests the approaches described in the document. As such it can be difficult to reference the document in discussions or in other papers. In order to make this easier we will snapshot significant updates as release versions as PDFs and include them in the repository. If its important to reference a more incremental change than that changes commit hash may be more practical.
